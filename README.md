## Project Description

Mainly focused on react js front-end development. I used css for styling. Also, this application used React Context API and redux for state management.

This chat app has basic chat app functionalities such as login, register, reset password, chat, conversation, group call, contact, starred messages, medial, files and links, settings, profile, edit profile, emoji pickers and etc. We can implement all the features using backend in future. 

You can change theming colors and dark and light modes by clicking settings icon in bottom-left cornaer.
